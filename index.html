<h2>Professional/Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Innovative Defense Technologies, Arlington, VA</h3>
<p><em>Software Engineer</em><br>
July 2023 – Present</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a Java-powered data loading system to ingest binary data, employing external data dictionaries for file decoding, and subsequently storing the decoded information into a PostgreSQL database. Integrated this system into a C++ core application, streamlining data verification processes for customers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed and implemented a solution for an internal R&D initiative enabling seamless integration of a Joystick and Throttle controller, allowing precise control in a flight simulator over a virtual network. Developed in Python utilizing libraries such as Pygame and PyInput, this pioneering project served as a proof of concept for more realistic and accurate VNC simulator testing, addressing limitations posed by Apache Guacamole's keyboard and mouse integration.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>C3 AI, McLean, VA</h3>
<p><em>Software Engineer - Federal</em><br>
July 2022 – July 2023</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed an energy management platform for public utility firms, utilizing TypeScript objects and Ajax calls to efficiently display meter usage trends on a user-friendly dashboard, resulting in up to 9% cost reduction and 16% pollution reduction in specific targeted areas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilized Python libraries, notably Pandas, to generate and import essential data for a strategic routing project. Additionally, applied front-end development principles with a focus on designing and implementing intuitive navigation menus and interactive elements, enhancing information display for users.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Spatial Front Inc, Fairfax, VA</h3>
<p><em>Software Developer</em><br>
January 2022 – July 2022</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Created responsive, accessible (508-compliant) User-Interfaces utilizing JavaScript and connected API endpoints to support CRUD operations in a Scaled Agile framework to modernize software applications for multiple clients.
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilized ReactJS and Bootstrap to engineer and implement sophisticated functionalities, such as automation and intelligent search and filtering integration, resulting in substantial productivity enhancements and significantly improved user workflow.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>CarMax, Richmond, VA</h3>
<p><em>Technology Intern – Data Science and Machine Learning Team</em><br>
June 2021 – August 2021</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Engineered and developed four sophisticated computer vision machine learning models focused on enhancing image quality and rectifying tens of thousands of blurry images for the CarMax customer website, thereby enriching the visual aesthetics and overall user experience on the platform. Employed a holistic methodology, harnessing NumPy for fast Fourier transforms (FFT) in crucial data preprocessing stages, OpenCV for image processing, and PyTorch for constructing and training neural networks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a lightweight FastAPI-based API for machine learning models, containerized with Docker, and efficiently deployed onto Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Managed the complete machine learning lifecycle using MLFlow, ensuring smooth experimentation, reproducibility, and successful model deployment and maintenance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Experience</h2>

<h3>Virginia Tech Hume Center, Blacksburg, VA</h3>
<p><em>Student Researcher – Using Artificial Intelligence as a Predicting Tool for Limb Salvage Versus Amputation Project</em><br>
January 2021 – May 2021</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed an AI/ML framework using TensorFlow and Keras to aid surgeons in limb amputation decisions by compiling diverse data points like injury images and nurses' notes. Designed a structured pipeline for AI training, testing, and evaluation, optimizing models for maximum accuracy and efficiency.
  </li>
